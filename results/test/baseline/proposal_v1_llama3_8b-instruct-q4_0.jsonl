If I'm not mistaken, this is translating a user-provided `wtimeout` in the connection string into `wTimeoutMS`.\n\nhmm, I think we can just do `new Error(assembly.error)` and that should set `error.message` correctly too. Should we do `error.assembly = assembly` so the template editor can access it that way, rather than parsing `error.details`?\n\nWhat if we changed this to this? roleText=attrs.get('roleText', lambda:getSpeechTextForProperties(reason=reason,role=role)) That will prevent the function from ever needing called in the roletext case, and removes that if.\n\nShouldn't this be `tm_cpp` to match `temporalImp`? (There are multiple CPP implementations, so 'cpp' is ambiguous.).\n\nCan we give this field a more descriptive name? When I use a variable named `icon` I normally expect an `Image` object.\n\nWe don't have `target_name` on `@sensor` - why introduce it for `@asset_sensor`? If we do want to introduce it everywhere, can we just call it `job_name` to avoid introducing a new term?\n\n`hex(i)[2:]` is trying to do the same thing above. what is `i` in your malformed case?\n\nThis just feels weird... can we use some kind of constant here? something like: `if (_.isUndefined(data) || data === PrivateKey.Random)`\n\nI think the more complete solution will save off a `ignoreUndefined` in the base class for the bulk operation (with a default of `false`), and use that for calculations.
