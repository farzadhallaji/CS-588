### Summary
The code changes are mostly correct and follow the best practices. However, there are a few improvements that can be made:
1. The `evp_md_from_dispatch` function should be NULL checked for `md`.
2. The `SSL_SRP_CTX_init` function should be memset() of `srp_ctx`.
3. The `AmpA4A` class should remove the `#ifdef` checks for `WITH_XCB_ERRORS` and `HAS_EXECINFO`.""",Ma,1,1,
